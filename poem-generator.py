##                      RANDOM POEM GENERATOR                      
## THE IDEA 
## - a program that generates poems by choosing random verbs, nouns, 
## adjectives, and adverbs, and inserting them into a built-in 
## template 
## 
## COMPONENTS 
## [âœ”] Lists of verbs, nouns, adjectives, and adverbs
## [ ] Some type of poem structure that contains the number of lines,
##     number of stanzas, and contents (?) of the poem 
## [ ] Function that initializes a poem structure 
## [ ] Function that populates the poem structure with content 
## [ ] Function that prints out the poem to the screen
## [ ] List of sentence structure templates, fill in the blank style
##     (I'll make the file for this myself)
